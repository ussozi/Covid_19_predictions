# Covid_19 Death Cases predictions per country

We are trying to predict deaths caused by Covid 19 per country cummulatively into the future.

### Language of choice is python

## There are three files

a) Data preparation file- Covid_19_Data_Prep_Allcountries.ipynb

b) Exploratory Analysis- Covid__19 EDA.py

c) Predictions- covid_19_predictions.py

Run the files in that order, however the Exploratory Analysis can be skipped and the predictions file is run since they donot depend on each other.

Let us crack on

### Enjoy--
