# Covid_19_predictions
We are trying to predict deaths caused by Covid 19 per country cummulatively into the future.

Language of choice is python

There are three files
a) Data preparation file- Covid_19_Data_Prep_Allcountries.ipynb

b) Exploratory Analysis- Covid__19 EDA.py

c) Predictions- covid_19_timeseries_prediction.py

Run the files in that order

Let us crack on

Enjoy--
